TestBox is a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and Test Driven Development (TDD) framework for [BoxLang JVM Language](https://www.boxlang.io) and ColdFusion (CFML). It also includes mocking and stubbing capabilities via its internal MockBox library.  We also recommend you install the `testbox-cli` (https://www.forgebox.io/view/testbox-cli) package to leverage commandline test runners, test generations and watchers using CommandBox.

## Requirements

* BoxLang 1+
* Lucee 5+
* Adobe ColdFusion 2021+

## Installation

You can visit the TestBox documentation page to view all of its features and
capabilities.  To install TestBox just drop it in your web root as `/testbox` or
create a mapping `/testbox` that points to it.

You can also use [CommandBox](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox) to install and leverage TestBox for commandline executions, test generations, watchers and much more:

### Stable Release

```bash
box install testbox-cli testbox
```

### Bleeding Edge Release

`box install testbox@be`

Bleeding edge builds are updated automatically as code is committed.

## License

Apache License, Version 2.0.

## Versioning

TestBox is maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

```html
<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

### HONOR GOES TO GOD ABOVE ALL

Because of His grace, this project exists. If you don't like this, then don't read it, its not for you.

>"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
Holy Ghost which is given unto us. ." Romans 5:5


### THE DAILY BREAD

 > "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me (JESUS)" Jn 14:1-12
