# Contributing to TestBox

## Thanks

[put some welcome text here]


## Forking / branching requirements

[no idea what to put here, because *this is the information I need to know*. This needs to come from the project owner, not a contributor (especially one who is trying to work out how to even contribute!).

It should contain guidance on requirements on forking (ie: that one has to? Does one?), and a naming strategy for branches (I'm using TESTBOX-xxx_brief_description, where TESTBOX-xxx is Jira the ticket I am addressing). Should I even be working in a branch? Should I be just using trunk-based development? I'm guessing not as you have a "development" branch. So is it "development-based development"? I dunno.]


## Installation requirements

[How to install the TestBox application in readiness for being able to work on it, run its tests etc. Simply grabbing the files is inadequate, I have found out: I need to run `box install` to get some dependencies. It's not immediately obvious this is necessary, nor should you assume a contributor needs to use another Ortus product to work on this Ortus product. Is there anything else you're just assuming I know I ought to have done?]


## Quality guidelines

[Are there CFML code quality guidelines? Should work conform to  https://github.com/Ortus-Solutions/coding-standards/blob/master/coldfusion.md. Are there any gotchas? What sort of things have ppl done in the past that they needed to address before you'd accept a pull request, that mght not seem immediately obvious? Any style to follow when making commit messages? I haven't looked, but I presume there is also JS and CSS in here too. What are the guidelines for those?]


## Development requirements

[What processes need to be run on code changes before they're ready to be submitted for pull request? Do I need to run anything? Do I need to make sure I have 100% code coverage on new code? How do run the coverage report? Anything else? If there's nothing: say that. Be clear.]


## Documentation expectations

[Are there any minimum documentation requirements that need to accompany any code? If there are none: say that.]


## Pull requests

[How to make them. Might be covered by the point above.]


## Contact

[Who to contact if there are questions regarding making contributions]


## Anything else?

[Probably]
